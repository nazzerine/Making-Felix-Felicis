Basic Algorithms - Spring 2018
Prompt:
Hermione is currently working on an assignment for making the Felix Felicis potion as it is a good idea to have good luck when they are searching for the Horcruxes. The only problem is that this is a very complex potion to make. She wants to speed it up by splitting the potion into multiple parts where each part can be done separately and independently. Unfortunately even though she has managed to figure out these parts she does need to mix them up at some point to get all the intermediate concoctions.

Help Hermione get the best way for making the potion.
